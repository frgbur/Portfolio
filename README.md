## 🧑‍💻 About Me
#  Hi, I'm Franciszek Gbur  
### Networking & Cybersecurity Student • Hands-On Labs • IT Infrastructure • Automation

I'm a networking and cybersecurity student with real practical experience designing, configuring, and troubleshooting Cisco networks and Windows Server environments.  
I enjoy secure network design, routing protocols, automation, and solving technical problems in a structured, analytical way.

This portfolio highlights the projects I've built — both academic and professional — including routing labs, VPN setups, DirectAccess, Windows Server deployments, iSCSI storage, and a real industrial automation project for LG Energy Solution.
