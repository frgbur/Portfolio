# Multi-Area OSPF & EIGRP Routing Lab

## 📝 Overview
A Cisco routing lab focusing on multi-area OSPF and EIGRP (named mode).  
Built on Packet Tracer / CML / real routers.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Implement multi-area OSPF design  
- Configure EIGRP named mode  
- Use prefix-lists and route filters  
- Tune timers (hello/dead)  
- Configure passive interfaces  
- Verify neighbor adjacency and routing tables  

## 🛠️ Technologies
Cisco IOS • OSPFv2 • EIGRP Named Mode • Prefix-Lists • IPv4 • IPv6
